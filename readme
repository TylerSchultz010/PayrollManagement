I wanted to share something I've been working on for a little while. Its a Payroll Web Application. It is similar to the payroll applications we all see in our normal lives, except this one was developed by me!

A couple of notes:

1. The phpmailer package used in this application was not developed by me. You can find the package source here: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

2. With phpmailer in send-email.php, I commented out the email and password. Here you should manually input your own gmail credentials.

3. My good friend Tommy Noudaranouvong developed the login form. Additionally he also added registering compatibility which you can find on his github: https://github.com/tschult2/Payroll/tree/Tommy

Thanks and enjoy
